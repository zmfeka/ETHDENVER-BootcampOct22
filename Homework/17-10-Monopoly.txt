Question:
    Homework 1

    Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like,
    if there was no software on a central server.

    Consider
        What are the essential pieces of functionality ?
        How would people cheat ?
        How could you prevent them from cheating ?

    This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed
    design.

Answer:
    The game would start when all the playerslog into and accept the terms, and each stake the same amount, eg $25 each to play the game
    They would each be allotted the same amount in the games currency eg 2500 game coins
    The players play each round simultaneuosly and the result of the round is revealed to all players when they have all completed the round
    Round 1(the steps for each player):
        Play chooses an amount to bid from their game coins
        Player roles the dice and lands on a property
        The result are shown to all players
        If players initial bid matches or exceeds the cost of the title deed, property is automatically purchased for that player
        If 2 players land on the same property, option to purchase goes to highest bid
        If property belongs to a player, rent is taken from player on the property
        If player lands on chance or community chest, result is revealed along with other players' results
